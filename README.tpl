# Minimal Rust

This is a list of Rust libraries which have zero, one, or two total
dependencies with `default-features = false`, as reported by `cargo tree.`

Some of these trade dependencies for completeness, meaning they have a
limited amount of features compared to their more well-known cousins,
while some of these **are** the more well-known cousins and are listed
because they already have minimal dependencies, like `memchr`.

dependencies:

## The List

$$LIST$$

â€  _Dependency count is determined by running `cargo tree` on an empty
project with the crate included with `default-features = false`.
Specifically running `make count CRATE=<name>` from the root of this repo._
